# Ratnalabala ✨

**Ratnalabala** is a digital project inspired by my grandfather, Sri Venkata Ratnam’s Telugu poetry written in 1983.  

Using AI, I translated these poems into English, transformed them into cartoon illustrations, and created a short video titled **“Padyalavala Bhavala Mala Ratnalabala.”**

This project blends tradition with modern AI creativity to share poetry in a new visual and musical format.
